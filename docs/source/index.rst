CTDYN: the Catania dynamo code
=================================

CTDYN provides a Fortran implementation of the stellar mean field dynamo problem
(see `Bonanno 2004 <https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2004MSAIS...4...17B/abstract>`_
and `Jouve et al. 2008 <https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2008A%26A...483..949J/abstract>`_).
It is released together with the auxiliary Python module `py_ctdyn` which offers
a dedicated interface for running CTDYN and analysing its output.

For now the source code is hosted on a private `GitHub repository <https://github.com/sybreton/CTDYN>`_.
