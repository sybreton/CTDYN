# CTDYN

This a fork of the Catania dynamo code project originally
developed by Alfio Bonanno. 

## Get started

The first thing is to compile the source code

`cd src`

`make`

An executable should be created at the root of the repository under the name
`spectra.x`.  The executable can then be run in the following fashion by
selecting an input file in the `parameters` directory.

`./spectra.x parameters/input`
