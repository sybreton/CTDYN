  which: number of utility modules was significantly reduced,
  the precision of integer variables is now systematically explicited
  when declared, unused namelist variables were removed. 
- A timer option was added, allowing to monitor the total time of
  a CTDYN run and the invidual time taken by calls to LAPACK routines.
- The code installation requirements was updated and clarified.
  In particular, CTDYN now requires an installation of the Fortran 
  Standard Library.
